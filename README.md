## Getting Started
Once you clone the the repository, make sure you run `bundle install` in your application folder to verify all the gems are compatible.
We are using the latest version of Materialize, and the latest version of Ruby in application. You may run into formatting/compatibility issues if your local versions are not up to date.

## Technologies
* Materialize
* jQuery
* font-awesome
* jquery.validate

## Future Development
1. Extend the features of this app to fields outside of web development
2. Expand MVP to include mentees interaction on app. Many to many relationship
3. Include 3rd party geolocation API to allow mentees and mentors to meet in person (possibly using Meetup's API)
